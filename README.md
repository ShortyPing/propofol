# Propofol

A simple, specialized web scraper made with Puppeteer and named after my favourite substance.<br>
Just like propofol, this piece of software is not 100% legal to use by everyone, so don't: It's just for educational purposes.

### Dotenv file
Propofol uses the `.env` file for storing credentials and miscellaneous settings required for its operation. The following
is a brief description of what a such file should look like:
```dotenv
PROPOFOL_EMAIL=your_email
PROPOFOL_PASSWORD=your_password
PROPOFOL_ID=book_id
PROPOFOL_HEADLESS=true_or_false
```
